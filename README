OpenDwarfs
==========
  The OpenDwarfs project provides a benchmark suite consisting of different computation/communication idioms, i.e., dwarfs, for state-of-art multicore CPUs, GPUs, Intel MICs and  Altera FPGAs. 
  The first instantiation of the OpenDwarfs has been realized in OpenCL, as briefly described in "OpenCL and the 13 Dwarfs: A Work in Progress" by Feng, Lin, Scogland, and Zhang in the 3rd ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering, April 2012. 
  The latest version, which contains an in-depth performance evaluation on a subset of OpenDwarfs, is described in "On the Characterization of OpenCL Dwarfs on Fixed and Reconfigurable Platforms" by Krommydas, Feng, Owaida, Antonopoulos, and Bellas in the 25th IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP), June 2014.

The computation/communication idioms are based on the 13 Berkeley Dwarfs:

Requirements
------------

Packages and libraries needed to build and run the applications.

To build:

    opencl >= 1.0 (some apps require 1.1, but we do not yet guarantee support for 1.2 in all applications.)
    autoconf >= 2.63
    autoheader
    automake
    libtool
    gcc
    maker

To run:

    opencl libs

Building
--------

To build all of the included applications:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make

To build only the applications you select, call configure with the --with-apps
option:

    $ ../configure --with-apps=srad,gem,cfd

To see a full list of options and applications:

    $ ../configure --help

Building for Altera devices (Quartus 13.1)
-------
You have to ensure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH are set to /usr/local/altera/13.1/hld/linux64/lib (or any other Altera lib directory)
For csr benchmark
    $ ../configure --with-AOCL=/usr/local/altera/13.1/hld --with-apps=csr
    $ make AM_CPPFLAGS="" LIBS="-lalteracl -lalterahalmmd -lalterammdpcie -lelf -lrt -lstdc++"

Running
-------

See the application-specific README file in each application's directory.
All the dwarf applications support a common list of options for optionally specifying the OpenCL platform ID (-p) and OpenCL device ID (-d), or alternatively, the device type (-t). These options, if supplied, must follow the executable name and be delimited from the application-specific options by double dashes (--).

General format: ./<executable> [-p <platform> -d <device> | -t <type> --] [app-specific options]

    <platform>	:integer ID of platform to use
    <device>    :integer ID of device in <platform> to use
    <type>	: device type to use (0:CPU, 1:GPU, 2:MIC, 3:FPGA)

Example1: ./astar -p 0 -d 0 -- (selects device with device ID 0 on platform with platform ID 0)
Example2: ./astar -t 0 -- (selects CPU device type on default platform with platform ID 0, if available)

Notes:	If no parameters are supplied, default platform ID is 0 and default device type is CPU.
	If -t parameter is given, default platform ID 0 is searched for supplied device type <type>. If not available, CPU device type selection will be attempted.
	If device ID is unknown, a combination of -p and -t is available to search for device of selected <type> on platform ID <platform>.

This project has been supported in part by Air Force Research Lab, Altera, AMD, Department of Defense, Harris, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Xilinx via the NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC) under NSF grant IIP-0804155 and indirectly by AFOSR grant FA9550-12-1-0442 and NSF grants CNS-0916719 and MRI-0960081.

Integration for Altera FPGA support for crc and csr, as well as extensions for these
benchmarks, have been contributed by Tyler Kenney at IBM.

Part of the OpenDwarfs benchmark suite (as acknowledged in the respective benchmarks' READMEs) was ported to OpenCL from the corresponding CUDA implementations in earlier implementations of the Rodinia benchmark suite (http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/wiki/rodinia/index.php/Main_Page).
